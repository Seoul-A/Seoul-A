# 👋 Hey there! I'm Seoul-A!  

> *"Code, coffee, and a little bit of chaos."* ☕💻  

## 🚀 Who Am I?  
🎮 Gamer by night, programmer by day (sometimes the other way around).  
🏀 Hooping on the court, dunking on bugs in code.  
⛏️ Mining both in games and in real life—because why not?  
✍️ Writing about local businesses & the stories behind them.  

## 🔥 What I Do  
- 💻 Exploring the world of programming, one bug at a time.  
- 🎨 Building cool stuff—sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  
- 🚀 Always up for learning new things, breaking stuff, and fixing it again.
